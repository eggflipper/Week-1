    <p>Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get their creative flow going at the
        beginning of the day. The writer has no idea what topic the random paragraph will be about when it appears. This
        forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three common <i>writing</i> challenges. The writer can use the
        paragraph as the first one of a short story and <strong>builds</strong> upon it. A second option is to use the random paragraph
        somewhere in a short story they create. The third option is to have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph
        in a short story. No matter which of these <b>challenges</b> is undertaken, the writer is forced to use creativity to
        incorporate the paragraph into their writing.z
